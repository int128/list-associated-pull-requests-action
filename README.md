# list-associated-pull-requests-action [![ts](https://github.com/int128/list-associated-pull-requests-action/actions/workflows/ts.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/int128/list-associated-pull-requests-action/actions/workflows/ts.yaml)

This is an action to generate a list of pull requests associated to a pull request.


## Purpose

### Problem to solve

For a mono repository (monorepo) and Git/GitLab Flow, we create a pull request to deploy changes to an environment such as production.

```mermaid
gitGraph
  commit id: "Initial"
  branch production
  checkout main
  commit id: "A"
  commit id: "B"
  commit id: "C"
  checkout production
  merge main
  checkout main
  commit id: "D"
  commit id: "E"
  commit id: "F"
  checkout production
  merge main
  checkout main
  commit id: "G"
```

A pull request often becomes too large to review, for example,

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/321266/179123581-3821d840-3b2b-4c8a-80a5-0d119f661c6b.png">

### How to solve

This action inspects a pull request and extracts the associated pull requests.

It brings the following benefits:

- You can review what to deploy
- If a repository consists of Microservices, each team can review changes of their service

## Inspect a pull request

You can generate the list of the pull requests associated to the current pull request.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  comment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: int128/list-associated-pull-requests-action@v1
        id: associated-pull-requests
        with:
          pull-request: ${{ github.event.number }}

      # post it to the current pull request
      - uses: int128/comment-action@v1
        with:
          post: |
            ## Associated pull requests
            ${{ steps.associated-pull-requests.outputs.body }}
```

This action resolves associated pull requests by the following steps:

1. Find the commits between base and head branch using GitHub Compare API
2. Fetch the associated pull requests using GitHub GraphQL API

Here is an example.

<img width="920" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/321266/171992826-2a2b915e-7833-4134-a568-9ff300c47089.png">

## Group by paths

You can group associated pull requests by paths.
This feature is useful for monorepo.

```yaml
      - uses: int128/list-associated-pull-requests-action@v1
        with:
          group-by-paths: |
            backend
            frontend
```

Here is an example.

<img width="920" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/321266/171991965-82726459-05f9-4916-8069-55b4d7322a93.png">

You can put a comment into `group-by-paths`.
This action ignores a line which starts with `#`.
For example,

```yaml
      - uses: int128/list-associated-pull-requests-action@v1
        with:
          group-by-paths: |
            # microservices
            payment-frontend
            payment-backend
            # monolith
            frontend
            api
```

### How it groups

This action fetches the following lists:

- A list of pull requests associated to a pull request
- A list of commits of subtree for each path

If a commit exists in a path, the associated pull requests of the commit are grouped to the path.

For example, if the following commits exist,

- Commit A, Pull Request #1, changed paths are `api` and `backend`
- Commit B, Pull Request #2, changed path is `api`
- Commit C, Pull Request #3, changed path is `backend`

this action returns the following markdown:

```markdown
### api
- #1
- #2
### backend
- #1
- #3
```

### Others group

If a pull request does not belong to any group, it is grouped as "Others".
You can hide the Others group by `show-others-group`.


## Compare base and head

You can generate the list of the pull requests between base and head branch.

```yaml
jobs:
  comment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: int128/list-associated-pull-requests-action@v1
        id: associated-pull-requests
        with:
          base: production
          head: main

      # post it to the current pull request
      - uses: int128/comment-action@v1
        with:
          post: |
            ## Associated pull requests
            ${{ steps.associated-pull-requests.outputs.body }}
```
